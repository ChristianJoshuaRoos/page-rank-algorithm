For problem 2, the following list describes how many iterations it took for each
input graph to achieve convergence.  With teleportation, the number of iterations
dramatically decreases.  

File						Number of Iterations
threeVertexGraph			8
threeVertexGraphSpiderTrap	12
threeVertexGraphDeadEnd		3
sevenVertexGraph			7
